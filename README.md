Thank you for choosing Forge Business!

A small gift from Forge and me! We’ve added a ton of new features! Now it’s truly a cool, cool script!

Several bugs have been fixed, such as the issue where the playback time from the config was not being captured.
A Discord LOG system has been added using webhooks. It will notify on Discord every time a business is opened or closed, including the reason and the player involved.
The opening and closing system has been improved. It is now compatible with both ESX and QB frameworks and records the opening time for each business.
In ESX, the business will automatically close if:
The player leaves the server and there are no more staff on duty.
The player changes jobs and there are no more staff on duty.
In QB, the business will automatically close if:
The player leaves the server and there are no more staff on duty.
The player changes jobs and there are no more staff on duty.
The player goes off-duty and there are no more staff on duty.
Statistics system: Administrators can now use a command and check the logs to see how long each business has been open and how many times it has been opened. This provides better management and control over your servers.
